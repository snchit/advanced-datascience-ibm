# # Context
#
# Enexis, Liander, and Stedin are the three major network administrators of the Netherlands and, together, they provide energy to nearly the entire country. Every year, they release on their websites a table with the energy consumption of the areas under their administration.
#
# The data are anonymized by aggregating the Zipcodes so that every entry describes at least 10 connections.
#
# This market is not competitive, meaning that the zones are assigned. This means that every year they roughly provide energy to the same zipcodes. Small changes can happen from year to year either for a change of management or for a different aggregation of zipcodes.

# # Dataset
# Every file contains information about groups of zipcodes managed by one of the three companies for a specific year.
#
# The dataset was downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/lucabasa/dutch-energy/

# # Inspiration
# - How are the smart meters spreading?
# - What is the trend of home-produced energy? (solar panel)
# - Can we see if there are many electric cars in a neighborhood?
# - What is going to be the energy consumption the next year?
